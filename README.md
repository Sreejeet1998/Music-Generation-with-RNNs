# Music-Generation-with-RNNs

This project focuses on generating music using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). By training RNN models on a dataset of music sequences, the model learns patterns in melodies and can generate new, unique pieces of music.
Features

    RNN Architecture: Implements an RNN-based model to generate music sequences.
    LSTM Cells: Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to capture long-term dependencies in the music data.
    Music Data Processing: Handles input music data, encoding it into a format suitable for model training.
    Music Generation: Creates new melodies by sampling from the trained RNN model.
    MIDI File Support: Generates MIDI files as output, allowing for playback of the generated music.

# Requirements

    Python 3.8+
    TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used)
    Other dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Install them with:

    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

# Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Sreejeet1998/Music-Generation-with-RNNs.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd Music-Generation-with-RNNs

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Prepare Dataset: Gather a dataset of MIDI files to train the model. Ensure the data is properly preprocessed into sequences.
    Model Training: Train the RNN model on the preprocessed music sequences:

    bash

python train_model.py --data music_sequences.csv

Generate Music: After training, generate new music pieces by sampling from the model:

bash

    python generate_music.py --output new_music.mid

    Play the Music: Use any MIDI player to listen to the generated music or further refine it using music production tools.

# Customization

You can experiment with different RNN architectures, such as adding more layers or using different types of recurrent units (LSTM, GRU), to improve music generation quality. The training data and model parameters can be adjusted for different musical styles.
