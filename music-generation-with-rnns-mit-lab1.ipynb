Because of how the RNN state is passed from timestep to timestep, the model will only be able to accept a fixed batch size once it is built.\n\nTo run the model with a different batch_size, we'll need to rebuild the model and restore the weights from the latest checkpoint, i.e., the weights after the last checkpoint during training:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = build_model(vocab_size, embedding_dim, rnn_units, batch_size=1)\n\n# Restore the model weights for the last checkpoint after training\nmodel.load_weights(tf.train.latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir))\nmodel.build(tf.TensorShape([1, None]))\n\nmodel.summary()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Notice that we have fed in a fixed batch_size of 1 for inference.\n\n**The prediction procedure**\n\nNow, we're ready to write the code to generate text in the ABC music format:\n\n* Initialize a \"seed\" start string and the RNN state, and set the number of characters we want to generate.\n\n* Use the start string and the RNN state to obtain the probability distribution over the next predicted character.\n\n* Sample from multinomial distribution to calculate the index of the predicted character. This predicted character is then used as the next input to the model.\n\n* At each time step, the updated RNN state is fed back into the model, so that it now has more context in making the next prediction. After predicting the next character, the updated RNN states are again fed back into the model, which is how it learns sequence dependencies in the data, as it gets more information from the previous predictions.\n\n![image.png](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/bb813743ff3e9def229e261e5223d83f926999024635cfa2fdeca399ddfc12db/68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f61616d696e692f696e74726f746f646565706c6561726e696e672f323031392f6c6162312f696d672f6c73746d5f696e666572656e63652e706e67)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### Prediction of a generated song ###\n\ndef generate_text(model, start_string, generation_length=1000):\n  # Evaluation step (generating ABC text using the learned RNN model)\n\n  input_eval = [char2idx[s] for s in start_string]\n  input_eval = tf.expand_dims(input_eval, 0)\n\n  # Empty string to store our results\n  text_generated = []\n\n  # Here batch size == 1\n  model.reset_states()\n  tqdm._instances.clear()\n\n  for i in tqdm(range(generation_length)):\n      predictions = model(input_eval)\n      \n      # Remove the batch dimension\n      predictions = tf.squeeze(predictions, 0)\n      predicted_id = tf.random.categorical(predictions, num_samples=1)[-1,0].numpy()\n      \n      # Pass the prediction along with the previous hidden state\n      #   as the next inputs to the model\n      input_eval = tf.expand_dims([predicted_id], 0)\n        \n      # Hint: consider what format the prediction is in vs. the output\n      text_generated.append(idx2char[predicted_id])\n    \n  return (start_string + ''.join(text_generated))\n     ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"generated_text = generate_text(model, start_string=\"X\", generation_length=1000)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Play back the generated music!**\n\nWe can now call a function to convert the ABC format text to an audio file, and then play that back to check out our generated music!
